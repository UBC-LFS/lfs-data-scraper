## Usage Guide
### Installing

The installation is just a command

```
 npm install csv-array
```

After installing the package you can use the "parseCSV" method as follows
```
 parseCSV("CSV-file-name.csv", callBack, considerFirstRowAsHeading)
   /*
      Where callBack is the method which have the output array as argument, and you can do 
      anything you like inside the function with the array

      "considerFirstRowAsHeading" is a configuration variable which holds "true" value 
      by default. If it is true or nothing then the first row of the csv data will be considered 
      as heading and the out put data will use the first row's content as attribute names.
      If it is "false" then all of the rows of the file will be returned as array.

      See example below.
